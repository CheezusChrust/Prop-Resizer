# Prop Resizer
 A visual prop resizer for Garry's Mod.

## Original Description

Resizes props, ragdolls and NPCs.
Does not resize the hitbox or shadow, therefore mainly useful for posing/videos.

I couldn't find this tool in the workshop so I thought I'd make my own.
I don't understand why the Inflator tool doesn't have this functionality? You just set the bone scale to a Vector anyway, so why not extend this to all entities and not just ragdolls.

If you want to resize ragdolls as a whole, go to Dispenser (Distraction Pyro)'s [Ragdoll Resizer!](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=182340669)
